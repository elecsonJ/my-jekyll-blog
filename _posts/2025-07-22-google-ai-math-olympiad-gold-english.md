# [News Analysis] Google AI Wins First Gold Medal at International Mathematical Olympiad

## üî• Key Summary

Google DeepMind's **Gemini Deep Think** perfectly solved 5 out of 6 problems at the 2025 International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), **scoring 35 points** and claiming the first gold medal in AI history. This represents a historic moment showing that AI has achieved human-level advanced mathematical reasoning capabilities.

**Key Keywords**: International Mathematical Olympiad, AI reasoning, natural language processing, mathematical proof, deep learning

## üì∞ What Happened?

### Core Incident

Google DeepMind officially announced on July 21st that its **Gemini Deep Think** model achieved gold medal-level performance at the 2025 International Mathematical Olympiad. The system perfectly solved 5 out of 6 problems **within the 4.5-hour time limit**, scoring 35 out of a possible 42 points.

Particularly, this achievement marks the first instance of AI **officially participating in the IMO** and being evaluated under the same conditions as human participants. IMO organizers evaluated: "Google DeepMind provided remarkable solutions in many respects, and judges found their solutions clear, accurate, and mostly easy to follow."

### Background Information

The International Mathematical Olympiad, started in 1959, is the world's most prestigious high school mathematics competition. This year, out of 630 participants, **only 67 (about 11%) received gold medals**, making it an extremely difficult competition.

Last year, Google's AlphaProof and AlphaGeometry 2 systems solved 4 problems achieving silver medal level (28 points), but required expert assistance. In contrast, this year's Gemini Deep Think solved problems **purely through natural language**, representing a qualitatively different breakthrough.

## üîç Why Is This Important?

### Technological Innovation

Gemini Deep Think's success represents several technological breakthroughs:

**1. Advancement in Natural Language Reasoning**
While previous AI systems required special format conversion to solve mathematical problems, this system **directly reasons in general natural language**. This is more similar to human thought processes.

**2. Implementation of Parallel Thinking**
The "Deep Think" mode implements parallel thinking functionality that simultaneously explores multiple solution paths. This mimics the thinking style of human mathematicians who approach complex problems from multiple angles.

**3. Development of Reinforcement Learning**
The application of reinforcement learning techniques for multi-step reasoning enables AI to learn optimal solution strategies on its own.

### Impact on the Industry

This achievement is expected to create major ripples throughout the AI industry. **OpenAI also announced achieving gold medal-level performance** around the same time but did not officially participate. This shows that competition among AI giants for mathematical reasoning capabilities is intensifying.

Particularly in **mathematics education**, revolutionary developments in AI tutoring systems are expected. AI capable of explaining and solving complex mathematical problems in natural language will open new possibilities for personalized mathematics education.

### Social Significance

This achievement demonstrates that AI has reached human levels not just in simple calculations or pattern recognition but also in **creative reasoning domains**. This greatly expands AI's potential applications in various fields including scientific research, engineering design, and complex problem-solving.

At the same time, **the education sector faces new challenges**. If AI can solve the highest-level mathematical problems, the goals and methods of human education must also be redefined.

## üîÆ What's Next?

### Short-term Outlook (3-6 months)

Google announced plans to release this technology in stages. **First testing with mathematicians**, then providing it through the Google AI Ultra subscription service at $250 annually.

Competitors won't stand still either. Major AI companies like OpenAI and Anthropic are expected to focus even more on **strengthening mathematical reasoning capabilities**.

### Long-term Outlook (1-3 years)

**Changes in the Education Market**: As AI math tutors become commercialized, personalized mathematics education will become commonplace. Students will be able to receive top-level mathematical mentoring 24/7.

**Acceleration of Scientific Research**: AI will be utilized as a core tool in physics, chemistry, and computer science research requiring complex mathematical proofs. This could significantly speed up new scientific discoveries.

**Emergence of New Job Categories**: New professions like "AI-mathematician" and "AI-education designer" that collaborate with AI will emerge. Roles focusing more on problem definition and interpretation rather than pure calculation will become important.

## üí≠ Personal Thoughts

Google AI's achievement is truly remarkable, but there are also points that require deep consideration.

**On the positive side**, it shows AI's potential as a tool for extending human intellectual capabilities. AI that solves complex mathematical problems can accelerate scientific research and provide better educational opportunities.

**However, there are concerning aspects**. Mathematics is an important educational process for building logical thinking foundations, but if AI solves all problems, human thinking ability might actually deteriorate.

**The most important thing is balance**. We should utilize AI not as a simple substitute but as a collaborative partner, while further developing uniquely human creativity and intuitive thinking.

Going forward, "what new problems can we discover and define together with AI" seems to be a more important question than "problems AI can solve."
