## Tool-Specific Prompting Tips

### VS Code + GitHub Copilot
```python
# Clear function signature and docstring
def optimize_delivery_route(
    warehouses: List[Location], 
    orders: List[Order], 
    vehicles: List[Vehicle]
) -> RouteOptimization:
    """
    Calculate optimal delivery routes considering vehicle capacity 
    and time constraints.
    
    Algorithm: Genetic Algorithm
    Time complexity: O(n¬≤)
    
    Returns:
        Optimized routes and estimated costs
    """
    # Copilot understands context and suggests implementation
```

### Cursor IDE
```javascript
// @ts-check
// Provide specific instructions to Cursor

/* 
Requirements:
1. Implement infinite scroll as React Hook
2. Use Intersection Observer API
3. Include loading state and error handling
