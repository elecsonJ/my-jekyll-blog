# üöÄ Complete Guide to MCP Servers for Immediate Practical Use

About 6 months have passed since Model Context Protocol (MCP) brought innovation to the AI industry. Major AI tools from Claude Desktop to Cursor and Windsurf are competing to support MCP. However, practical guides on **which MCP servers to use** and **how to utilize them specifically** have been lacking.

This post carefully selects and introduces servers that actually help improve productivity from among over 1000 MCP servers.

## üéØ What is MCP? (Quick Review)

MCP is a **standard protocol that connects AI models with external data sources**.

### Core Structure
```
MCP Host (Claude Desktop, Cursor, etc.)
   ‚Üì
MCP Client (built into host app)
   ‚Üì
MCP Server (external program)
   ‚Üì
External Data Sources (files, DB, API, etc.)
```

### 3 Core Functions
- **Tools**: Functions AI can call (weather API, calculator, etc.)
- **Resources**: Data sources AI can access (files, DB records, etc.)  
- **Prompts**: Templates users can utilize

## üìä Popular MCP Servers (Quick Overview)

First, let's briefly organize well-known servers:

### üè¢ Enterprise Essential Servers

## üíé Hidden Gems: Powerful but Not Popular MCP Servers

### 1. Memory Server - Long-term Memory System for AI

**What makes it special?**  
Existing AI forgets all information when conversations end. Memory Server solves this problem by providing **knowledge graph-based persistent memory**.

#### üß† Core Functions
- **Entity-Relationship based storage**: Storing relational knowledge, not simple text
- **Cross-session Persistence**: Maintaining learned content after session ends
- **Semantic Retrieval**: Meaning-based information search

#### üíº Practical Use Examples

**1. Building Personal Assistant**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-memory"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Use Scenarios:**
- **Remembering meeting participants**: "Assistant Manager Kim and Manager Park are from the marketing team, met at last month's Q4 performance meeting"
- **Tracking project history**: "React Project X started in March 2024, currently version 2.1, main issue is performance optimization"
- **Learning personal preferences**: "User prefers TypeScript, functional programming style, decreased concentration after 2 AM"

**2. Customer Relationship Management (CRM)**
```
Memory Entity Examples:
- Customer: "ABC Company"
  - Relationship: "purchased product" ‚Üí "Enterprise Plan"
  - Relationship: "contact person" ‚Üí "Director Lee Chulsoo"
  - Attribute: "purchase date" ‚Üí "2024-11-15"
  - Attribute: "renewal date" ‚Üí "2025-11-15"
```

#### üîß Advanced Usage Tips
- **Regular memory cleanup**: Monthly cleanup of unnecessary relationships
