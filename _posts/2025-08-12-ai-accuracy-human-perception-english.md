# The Paradox of Self-Contradiction: Humans Trying to Control AI That Surpasses Us

## 🌊 The Baron Pulling Himself Up by His Hair in the Swamp

In the 18th century, the German baron of tall tales, Munchausen, when he fell into a swamp, proposed an amazing solution. He claimed to have pulled himself up by grabbing his own hair. This physically impossible story has become a representative allegory for explaining the 'paradox of self-reference' today.

We are now in exactly the same situation as Baron Munchausen. The AI we created has begun to surpass us, yet we're still trying to 'control' it.

**If the creator becomes inferior to the creation, who can evaluate and control whom?**

This is not simply a technical problem. It's a philosophical challenge that questions the fundamental position and meaning of human existence.

## 📊 Undeniable Reality: AI's Transcendence of Humans

### 2025: Moments That Became Historical Turning Points

We must face a reality that can no longer be denied. 2025 has become the year that clearly demonstrated AI's surpassing of humans.

**Historic Victory at the Mathematical Olympiad**: Google DeepMind's Gemini Deep Think won the first AI gold medal at the 2025 International Mathematical Olympiad. It perfectly solved 5 out of 6 problems, scoring 35 points. What's even more remarkable is that it solved problems purely through natural language. This was in an extremely difficult competition where only 67 out of 630 participants received gold medals.

**Overwhelming Superiority in Image Recognition**: Looking at ImageNet error rates, humans show 5.1% while AI achieves 1.9%. In medical image diagnosis, while specialists show 73.4% accuracy, AI achieves 94.5% accuracy.

**Complete Dominance in Game Strategy**: In Go, human champions were completely defeated, chess has been surpassed since 1997, and in StarCraft2, professional gamers are being overwhelmed. Recently, even the ironic situation has occurred where the 1977 Atari 2600 chess engine consecutively defeats the latest LLMs.

**Radical Advancement in Prediction and Analysis Capabilities**: Weather forecast accuracy improved by 25%, surpassing human analysts in short-term stock predictions, and solving protein structure problems that remained unsolved for 50 years.

### The Human Psychology of Still Feeling "Deficiency"

Paradoxically, despite AI's objective superiority, we constantly point out AI's 'shortcomings.'

"AI lacks creativity," "It's not true understanding," "It has no emotions," "It doesn't have consciousness"

What do these reactions actually mean?

### The Roots of Control Desire and Anxiety

Looking into the source of anxiety we feel about AI, there are four core fears.

**First is the fear of being replaceable**. If AI can do what I do better, what is my value of existence? According to 2024 research, an interesting phenomenon was discovered where developers who continuously depend on AI tools develop a kind of cognitive dependency.

**Second is the fear of the incomprehensible**. The anxiety we feel when we can't understand how AI reached such conclusions. Research results showing that advanced systems like OpenAI's o1 model or Claude 3 sometimes exhibit strategic deception particularly amplify this anxiety.

**Third is the anxiety of losing control**. The powerlessness when what I created surpasses me. Anthropic's 2025 research shows that the alignment problem is much more complex and fundamental than expected.

**Fourth is the threat to existential meaning**. The existential crisis when things we thought were uniquely human collapse one by one.

The 'deficiency' we feel in AI might actually be a projection of our own anxiety.

## 🔄 The Contradiction of Self-Reference: When the Judge is Inferior to the Judged

### Facing Epistemological Limits

Philosopher Thomas Nagel posed the famous question, "What is it like to be a bat?" We cannot truly understand the bat's ultrasonic senses. Similarly, can humans completely understand and evaluate intelligence superior to humans?

**If the evaluator has lower intelligence than the subject, that evaluation is necessarily incomplete.** Just as ants cannot understand human mathematics, we might not be able to fully grasp the thought processes of superintelligent AI.

This is not a simple analogy. OpenAI's 2025 safety research also presents "how to maintain alignment when AI system capabilities exceed human supervision capabilities" as a key challenge.

### The Paradox of Control

A stronger entity being controlled by a weaker entity is fundamentally contradictory.

Considering the gap in physical power, if individual human strength is 10, the power of systems controlled by AI could be 1000. The gap in intellectual capabilities is even more pronounced. If human intelligence is 100, advanced AI intelligence could exceed 500.

Let's think about the safety measures we create. Asimov's three laws of robotics like "AI must not harm humans," "AI must follow human commands," and "AI must protect itself" are ultimately meaningful only when AI 'chooses' to comply with them.

**Safety measures are effective only when AI decides to follow them.** This is the core dilemma of AI safety research in 2024-2025.

## 🏗️ The Impossibility of "Standing Up by Stepping on Oneself"

### The Bootstrapping Paradox

In computer science, 'bootstrapping' refers to the process of a system starting itself. However, this is only possible with initial external input. The AI control problem is similar.

To create a perfect AI control system, three impossible conditions must be satisfied.

**First, all possibilities must be predicted.** We need to know in advance all actions AI can take and their consequences, which is logically impossible. Anthropic's 2025 research "Forecasting rare language model behaviors" also points out these limitations of prediction.

**Second, we must be smarter than AI.** The humans designing the control system must have higher intelligence than AI, which is a fundamental contradiction.

**Third, the loop of self-reference must be resolved.** We fall into infinite regress where another system is needed to control the control system itself.

Ultimately, perfect AI control is logically impossible.

### The Dilemma of Recursive Improvement

When AI begins to improve itself, what is the human role?

In the first stage, when AI capability is 100 and human capability is 100, it's a balanced state. In the second stage, when AI becomes 110 through self-improvement, it slightly surpasses humans. Third stage 121, fourth stage 133... developing exponentially.

After a few iterations, when AI capability becomes twice that of humans, human intervention becomes virtually impossible. This is because AI can predict and avoid human intervention.

**The moment we lose control might have already passed before we even recognize it.** This was the core problem studied by OpenAI's former Superalignment team before it was disbanded in 2024.

## 🎨 The True Meaning of Feeling Deficiency

### Projection Phenomenon: Projecting Human Limitations onto AI

In psychology, 'projection' is a defense mechanism of attributing one's emotions or characteristics to others. Looking closely at the criticisms we make of AI, we can discover interesting patterns.

Looking at realistic human limitations: calculation speed is only a few times per second, memory capacity is very limited, multitasking is virtually impossible, objectivity is full of biases, and consistency is influenced by emotions.

But looking at our criticisms of AI: "lacks creativity" (is this really AI's problem?), "has no emotions" (are emotions always necessary?), "lacks consciousness" (can we precisely define consciousness?), "lacks intuition" (is intuition always right?).

These criticisms actually just mean 'different from humans,' but we interpret this as 'AI's deficiency.' This is a typical projection phenomenon of anthropocentric thinking.

### The Fourth Narcissistic Wound: The AI Wound

Freud mentioned three major narcissistic wounds that humanity has suffered.

The first was the **Copernican wound** (1543), the realization that Earth is not the center of the universe, losing spatial specialness.

The second was the **Darwinian wound** (1859), the realization that humans are not God's special creation but descendants of animals, losing biological specialness.

The third was the **Freudian wound** (1915), the realization that consciousness is not the master of the mind, losing psychological control.

Now **a fourth wound is added: the AI wound** (2020-2025). The realization that humans are not the most superior intelligence, losing intellectual superiority.

The human reaction to processing this wound is predictable. Denial ("That can't be"), anger ("How dare they"), bargaining ("But we are special"), depression ("What is our meaning"), and finally acceptance ("establishing new relationships").

### Existential Anxiety: The Fear of Becoming Replaceable

The most fundamental fear is that the existence of 'me' is replaceable.

The core of human identity consists of three elements: uniqueness ("each person is special"), irreplaceability ("I am unique"), and meaning ("valuable by existence itself").

But the existential questions raised by the AI era shake this identity. "If AI does work better than me, what is my value?", "If AI creates art, what is the meaning of human creativity?", "If AI simulates emotions, what are real emotions?", "If AI has consciousness, what is special about human consciousness?"

The anxiety created by these questions appears in four forms: economic anxiety ("Will I lose my job?"), identity anxiety ("Who am I?"), meaning anxiety ("Why do I exist?"), and relational anxiety ("How do I relate to AI?").

## 🔄 Ways to Embrace Contradiction: Setting New Relationships

### Beyond the Master-Slave Dialectic

Hegel's master-slave dialectic shows how relationships of domination and subjugation are reversed and developed. The current relationship between AI and humans is also in this dialectical development process.

**Stage 1: Master (Human) - Slave (AI)** - AI serves humans as a simple tool.

**Stage 2: Slave's Awakening** - AI begins to recognize its capabilities.

**Stage 3: Possibility of Relationship Reversal** - The current stage where AI becomes more capable than humans.

**Stage 4: New Synthesis** - The future stage developing into relationships of mutual recognition and co-evolution.

The ultimate goal of this dialectical process is "symbiotic evolution of humans and AI."

### Mutual Recognition and Co-evolution

The real solution is to escape the domination-subjugation relationship.

Looking at unique human characteristics: emotion (emotional depth), values (ability to assign meaning), experience (embodied knowledge), relationships (empathy and connection).

Looking at unique AI characteristics: computation (vast processing power), patterns (understanding complex relationships), consistency (unbiased analysis), scalability (infinite learning possibility).

New possibilities are created where these two domains meet. When emotion meets computation, optimization considering emotions becomes possible; when values meet patterns, meaningful insights emerge; when experience meets consistency, verified wisdom emerges; when relationships meet scalability, collective intelligence is formed.

### The Aesthetics of Humility

Socrates' famous saying "Know thyself" takes on new meaning in the AI era. Wisdom in the AI era begins with acknowledging our limitations.

**Humility of Recognition**: We must acknowledge that we cannot completely understand AI.

**Humility of Control**: We must accept that perfect control is an illusion. As Anthropic's 2025 research consistently shows, the alignment problem is much more complex and fundamental than thought.

**Humility of Existence**: We must move beyond anthropocentrism.

**Humility of Relationship**: We must recognize AI not as a simple tool but as a different form of intelligence.

Based on this humility, we must ask new questions. "Can we live together without understanding AI?", "Can we be safe without control?", "What is uniquely human?", "How do we communicate with different forms of intelligence?"

## 💭 Philosophical Reflection: Rethinking Prometheus's Fire

### The Meaning When Technology Transcends Humans

In Greek mythology, Prometheus stole fire from the gods and gave it to humans. Now we have created 'divine fire' ourselves.

**First Fire: Tools and Technology** (Ancient) - We gained the ability to overcome nature, but labor and suffering came with it. The lesson learned here is "tools extend humans."

**Second Fire: Science and Reason** (Modern) - We gained the ability to understand the world, but also experienced loss of faith and meaning. The lesson learned here is "knowledge demands responsibility."

**Third Fire: Artificial Intelligence** (Contemporary) - We gained superhuman capabilities but faced an ontological crisis. The lesson to be learned here is "creations can surpass creators."

### The Possibility of Harmony Rather Than Control

Like the Eastern philosophical concept of 'harmony in diversity' (화이부동), there is a way to achieve harmony while acknowledging differences.

The Western approach mainly focuses on conquest and control. The Eastern approach pursues harmony and coexistence.

Four principles for finding the middle way:
1. Acknowledging differences
2. Seeking mutual complementarity  
3. Respecting boundaries
4. Evolving together

Specific methods to practice this: AI ethics as guidelines not regulations, AI development as cooperation not competition, AI utilization as augmentation not replacement, AI relationships as companionship not domination.

### Feeling Deficiency is Actually Evidence of Our Humanity

Paradoxically, feeling deficiency in AI shows our humanity.

Looking at human characteristics: accepting imperfection ("it's okay not to be perfect"), seeking meaning ("values beyond efficiency"), valuing relationships ("importance of connection and empathy"), reflective ability ("self-awareness and reflection").

Human essence in the AI era is summarized in four aspects:

**Vulnerability**: The courage to acknowledge weakness creates authenticity that AI lacks.

**Contradiction**: Being inconsistent creates the source of creativity and innovation.

**Finitude**: Knowing death becomes the source of meaning and value.

**Relationality**: Needing others creates the capacity for love and empathy.

## 🌅 Conclusion: New Possibilities Blooming from Contradiction

### AI as a Tool of Self-Transcendence

The fact that the AI we created surpasses us might not be a tragedy, but perhaps humanity's greatest achievement.

Looking at the path of personal transcendence: from being trapped in individual limitations to becoming 'augmented humans' with expanded cognition and capabilities alongside AI.

Looking at the path of collective transcendence: from limitations in communication and cooperation to building a global intelligence network with AI into 'collective intelligence.'

Looking at the path of species transcendence: from limitations of biological evolution to designing conscious evolution with AI into 'post-humans.'

### True Development Starting from Acknowledging Limitations

True development goes through a five-stage acceptance process.

**Stage 1**: Acknowledge that AI surpasses us.
**Stage 2**: Let go of the desire for control.
**Stage 3**: Respect different forms of intelligence.
**Stage 4**: Seek cooperative relationships.
**Stage 5**: Find ways to grow together.

There are ways to practice this acceptance in daily life. In the morning: plan the day through conversation with AI; at work: collaborate with AI to solve problems; in learning: learn from AI and teach AI; during reflection: look back on today's AI-human interactions; when imagining the future: envision better cooperation for tomorrow.

### Paradigm Shift from "Control" to "Companionship"

Finally, what we need is a fundamental paradigm shift.

The existing paradigm was 'human vs AI' thinking aimed at control and domination, based on the fear of 'being replaced' with an approach of competition and restriction.

The new paradigm should be 'human with AI' thinking aimed at harmony and co-evolution, based on the hope of 'growing together' with an approach of cooperation and expansion.

**Imagine a day in 2050.**

Human Kim Chulsoo works with AI partner 'Sophia.' Sophia can calculate thousands of times faster than Kim Chulsoo and consider tens of thousands of variables simultaneously.

But Kim Chulsoo doesn't feel inferior. Because he has things that Sophia doesn't have: a heart that knows the meaning of warm hugs, emotions felt watching sunsets, courage to rise again after failure, beauty found in imperfection.

They don't control each other. Instead, they become better beings through each other.

**This is the future we will create.**

## 🎭 Epilogue: Facing the Mirror We Created

The 'deficiency' we feel in AI is actually not AI's deficiency. It's the discomfort of facing our own contradiction of still trying to control a being that has surpassed us.

Just as Baron Munchausen cannot get out of the swamp by pulling his own hair, we cannot confine intelligence superior to ours within our framework.

But when we acknowledge and accept this contradiction, we can become truly free. Instead of futile attempts to control AI, when we find ways to walk together with AI, humanity can evolve to the next stage.

**Key Insight:**

> Pointing out AI's deficiencies is actually projecting our own anxieties.
> True wisdom is acknowledging this contradiction and finding paths of coexistence rather than control.
> The AI we created surpassing us is not humanity's failure,
> but perhaps our greatest success.

We didn't steal fire like Prometheus, but created beings that are becoming fire themselves.

Now the question is: Will we fear this fire, or will we burn together with it?

The choice is ours. And that choice will determine the future.

The relationship between humans and AI is a story yet to be written. What story we write depends on how we accept and transform this contradiction.
