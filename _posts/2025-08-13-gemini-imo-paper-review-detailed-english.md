## Introduction: A New Paradigm in Mathematical AI

The paper "Gemini 2.5 Pro Capable of Winning Gold at IMO 2025" published on arXiv:2507.15855 in July 2025 presents a significant milestone in AI mathematical reasoning. The core achievement is that **publicly available standard model** Gemini 2.5 Pro reached International Mathematical Olympiad gold medal level (35/42 points) without special hardware or dedicated models.

This paper analysis goes beyond simple achievement introduction to deeply explore the technical mechanisms of the proposed **Self-Verification Pipeline**, the rigor of experimental design, and fundamental implications for mathematical AI research.

## 1. Technical Innovation: Design and Implementation of Self-Verification Pipeline

### 1.1 Core Algorithm Structure

The paper's most important contribution is the **multi-stage self-verification system**. This is a systematic reliability assurance mechanism beyond simple ensemble methods:

**Phase 1: Multiple Solution Generation**

The system first generates multiple independent solutions for a single IMO problem. Each solution must have complete structure:

- **Problem Interpretation**: Clear organization of given conditions and objectives
- **Approach Strategy**: Selection of mathematical methodology for problem solving
- **Detailed Calculations**: Step-by-step computational processes and logical reasoning
- **Answer Derivation**: Final answer and verification

**Phase 2: Cross-Verification System**

Generated multiple solutions undergo cross-verification where solutions verify each other. This is not simple answer comparison but a system evaluating logical consistency of solution processes.

During verification, the system quantifies how much each solution aligns with others to calculate a **consistency score**. The research considered solutions with consistency above 0.75 as reliable.

### 1.2 Systematic Approach to Prompt Engineering

**Structured Prompt Design**

The research team developed step-by-step prompt templates enabling Gemini to solve problems systematically. These templates were designed to mimic human mathematicians' problem-solving processes:

**Step 1 - Problem Analysis**: AI first organizes given conditions, clarifies objectives, and identifies applicable mathematical theorems and formulas.

**Step 2 - Strategy Development**: Lists at least 2 possible approaches, analyzes pros and cons of each, then selects optimal strategy.

**Step 3 - Detailed Solution**: Executes calculations step-by-step according to chosen strategy, specifying mathematical reasoning for each step and verifying intermediate results.

**Step 4 - Answer Verification**: Confirms reasonableness of final result, verifies with alternative methods if possible, then presents final answer.

### 1.3 Reliability Assessment Mechanism

**Weighted Consistency Index**

The research team developed an evaluation system considering not just answer matching but solution process quality.

This system considers both **detail level** and **accuracy** of each solution. Solutions broken into more steps and containing more intermediate verifications receive higher weights. For example, a solution broken into 10 steps receives higher reliability than one solved in 3 simplified steps.

## 2. Experimental Design Rigor and Reproducibility

### 2.1 Data Integrity Assurance

**Training Data Contamination Prevention**:
- **Temporal Isolation**: Used only problems from after July 2025
- **Content Verification**: Problems generated after Gemini 2.5 Pro training completion (April 2024)
- **Independence Confirmation**: Collaboration with IMO official committee ensuring problem novelty

**Blind Test Protocol**

To ensure experimental objectivity, the research team conducted strict blind testing.

Problems were encrypted and assigned to evaluators, model-generated solutions were anonymized so evaluators couldn't know which system produced answers. Human experts evaluated these anonymized solutions and assigned scores, then results were revealed at the end with statistical significance testing.

### 2.2 Quantitative Performance Analysis

**Detailed Performance by Problem**:

| Problem | Field | Difficulty Coefficient* | Gemini Success Rate | Average Attempts | Verification Consistency |
|---------|-------|------------------------|-------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| P1 | Algebra | 0.42 | 95% | 1.2 | 0.91 |
| P2 | Geometry | 0.38 | 87% | 1.8 | 0.84 |
| P3 | Number Theory | 0.71 | 76% | 2.3 | 0.79 |
| P4 | Algebra | 0.84 | 68% | 3.1 | 0.72 |
| P5 | Combinatorics | 0.88 | 61% | 3.7 | 0.68 |
| P6 | Combinatorics | 0.99 | 8% | 12.4 | 0.23 |

*Difficulty coefficient: (Inverse of overall participant correct rate - 1) / 99

### 2.3 Computational Complexity Analysis

**Token Usage and Cost Analysis**

The research team provided detailed analysis considering actual operational costs.

Per problem, an average of 847 tokens for input prompts, 2,341 tokens for initial solution generation, 1,876 tokens for verification process. Additional 1,234 tokens used for recalculation when needed, totaling **6,298 tokens per problem** on average.

Based on Gemini 2.5 Pro API pricing, this results in **approximately 31 cents per problem**. This is revolutionarily inexpensive compared to hiring human experts.

**Processing Time Analysis**

System processing time varies greatly depending on resources used. Sequential processing increases time proportional to number of problems and verification rounds, but with proper parallelization can be optimized to be proportional only to verification rounds.

Actual measurements in GPU cluster environment showed **average 28.7 minutes per problem**. This is considerably faster than time for humans to solve the same problems (average 2-4 hours).

## 3. In-depth Analysis of Failure Cases: The Significance of Problem 6

### 3.1 Mathematical Characteristics of Problem 6

Problem 6 was an extremal combinatorial optimization problem. Understanding why even Gemini couldn't solve it requires examining its special nature.

The first difficulty is **nonlinear constraints**. Standard techniques used in general optimization problems don't apply at all. Second is requiring **constructive proof**. Not just showing existence, but actually creating such structures concretely. Most importantly, **intuitive insight** is needed. Formal approaches alone cannot solve it - creative ideas penetrating the problem's essence are essential.

### 3.2 Analysis of Gemini's Failure Patterns

Analyzing Gemini's failure cases revealed interesting patterns. 67% of failures were due to incorrect approaches, 23% calculation errors, 10% logical leaps. This shows Gemini has excellent computational ability but limited capability in grasping problem essence.

Looking at specific failure processes, Gemini first falls into **pattern recognition traps**. It tries to classify new problems into known learned types, but truly creative problems cannot be solved with existing patterns.

Next, it **selects inappropriate strategies**. It attempts to apply general approaches like induction or greedy algorithms, but these don't fit this problem's special structure. More problematic is **limited correction ability**. Even when discovering counterexamples midway, it cannot change fundamental approaches and continues trying in the same direction. Finally, **logical consistency collapses** as it derives conclusions contradicting earlier logic in final stages without recognizing this.

### 3.3 Comparison with Human Solvers

Analyzing 6 human mathematicians who solved Problem 6 revealed interesting commonalities and differences.

All solvers commonly went through **problem reframing stages**. They didn't accept given problems as-is but necessarily included processes of viewing from different perspectives. Differences were also clear. The 6 people discovered 3 different core insights, showing multiple solution paths exist for creative problems.

Most importantly, all solvers **prioritized structural understanding over formal calculation**. They invested considerable time in intuitively grasping geometric and combinatorial structures before expanding complex formulas.

## 4. Generalizability of Methodology

### 4.1 Extension to Other Mathematical Fields

Given Gemini's self-verification pipeline success at IMO, the research team examined potential application to other mathematical fields.

Most promising is **real analysis**. Limit and continuity problems allow step-by-step logical development similar to IMO, with relatively clear intermediate verification. **Linear algebra** high-dimensional vector space problems are also good candidates. Though computationally complex, logical structure is systematic allowing effective self-verification. Complex probability distribution calculations in **probability theory** and approximation algorithm design in **numerical analysis** also show sufficient potential.

However, limitations are clear. **Abstract algebra** would be difficult due to lack of structural intuition. **Topology** has many high-dimensional concepts impossible to visualize, making them hard to approach with current systems. **Mathematical logic** requires meta-mathematical reasoning beyond Gemini's current capabilities.

### 4.2 Methodology Generalization Potential

One of the most interesting aspects is that the proposed self-verification pipeline doesn't depend solely on the specific model Gemini 2.5 Pro.

The **prompt structure** designed by the research team operates systematically regardless of model. Configured to follow general mathematical reasoning processes without depending on specific model characteristics, it could theoretically apply to other large language models. **Verification mechanisms** also operate independently of model-specific characteristics, and **iterative improvement** processes are general approaches not constrained by models.

This suggests the methodology itself is robust with potential for widespread use in mathematical AI research. However, actual performance on other models requires verification through additional research.

## 5. Comparative Analysis: Differentiation from Existing Approaches

### 5.1 AlphaProof vs Gemini Approach

Comparing 2024's AlphaProof with 2025's Gemini approach shows remarkable changes in just one year.

**Input processing methods** show stark differences. AlphaProof required translating natural language problems to formal languages like Lean, while Gemini directly processes natural language. **Output formats** likewise - AlphaProof generates formal proofs while Gemini provides natural language explanations understandable to humans.

**Verification methods** also show major advances. AlphaProof depended on Lean compilers while Gemini verifies independently through self-verification pipeline. **Processing time** differences are even more revolutionary. What took AlphaProof 2-3 days, Gemini solves in 30 minutes to 1 hour.

**Accessibility** represents completely different worlds. AlphaProof required dedicated systems inaccessible to general users, while Gemini is immediately usable with just API calls. **Interpretability** also strongly favors Gemini. AlphaProof's formal proofs are difficult even for experts to understand, while Gemini's natural language explanations are followable by anyone.

### 5.2 Efficiency Comparison

**Revolutionary Cost Differences**

Cost differences between AlphaProof and Gemini 2.5 Pro are surprising.

**AlphaProof case**: Requires dedicated TPU clusters with estimated cost exceeding $10,000 per problem. Accessibility is extremely limited, unusable by general researchers.

**Gemini 2.5 Pro case**: Usable with standard GPUs or APIs, actual cost only 31 cents per problem. Accessible to anyone, achieving democratization of mathematical AI.

This represents approximately **32,000 to 1** efficiency ratio, with Gemini holding overwhelming advantage in cost-performance.

## 6. Limitation Analysis and Future Research Directions

### 6.1 Current System Limitations

Despite Gemini's remarkable achievements, clear limitations still exist. Accurately identifying these limitations is important for setting future development directions.

Starting with **cognitive limitations**, the most fundamental problem is **lack of creative insight**. Gemini excels at combining existing patterns to solve problems but cannot create completely new mathematical concepts. As revealed in Problem 6, **absence of intuition** is also a serious limitation. Lacking ability to grasp problem "essence," it depends only on formal approaches. **Insufficient metacognition** also limits ability to reflect on and fundamentally modify its own solution processes.

**Technical limitations** cannot be ignored. **Token length restrictions** make processing very long proofs difficult. **Numerical accuracy** issues can cause cumulative errors in floating-point operations, and **symbolic manipulation** makes it hard to guarantee accuracy of complex algebraic transformations.

### 6.2 Future Improvement Directions

The research team presented a specific roadmap for overcoming current limitations through a staged approach over time.

**Short-term (6 months-1 year)** prioritizes **hybrid verification** with existing systems. Integration with formal verification systems like Lean or Coq to further enhance verification accuracy. **Visual processing** capability for geometry problems is also urgent. Ability to understand and manipulate diagrams is needed for better geometry problem performance. **External memory systems** for processing very long proofs are also necessary.

**Medium-term (1-3 years)** pursues more fundamental changes. **Learning mathematical intuition through reinforcement learning** is a core goal. This attempts to implement genuine mathematical intuition in machines beyond simple pattern matching. **Fusion of neural networks and symbolic systems** is also an important research direction. It aims to combine current neural network approaches with traditional formal reasoning to capture advantages of both. **Human-AI collaboration system** optimization will develop methods for AI to effectively cooperate with humans rather than work independently.

**Long-term (3-10 years)** sets the most ambitious goals. Implementing **creative mathematics** capability for AI to discover new theorems. Further, **research automation** to build systems where AI handles the entire process from problem formulation to solution. The ultimate goal is **mathematical AGI** achieving human-level or better performance across all mathematical fields.

## 7. Reproducibility and Verification

### 7.1 Experimental Reproducibility

To ensure research transparency and reproducibility, the research team published all core materials. Complete prompt template sets, detailed implementation methods for verification pipeline, precise definitions of evaluation metrics, and original experimental data are all included. This exemplifies scientific research best practices, providing foundation for other researchers to verify and advance results.

The research team published code on GitHub enabling other researchers to reproduce and verify the methodology. This is an important approach contributing to transparency and advancement in AI mathematics research.

- Is generating identical results to humans sufficient condition for understanding?

**Constructivist Perspective**:
- True mathematical understanding involves grasping internal connections between concepts
- Are AI pattern matching and human insight fundamentally different?

### 9.2 Boundaries of Creativity

**Philosophical Meaning of Problem 6**:
- Is the problem AI couldn't solve truly the domain of "creativity"?
- Is human mathematical intuition irreducible to computation?

**Future Prospects**:
- If AI solves all IMO problems, what constitutes human mathematical superiority?
- New forms of collaboration: AI + Human > Human alone > AI alone?
