## Introduction

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has been hailed as a revolutionary technique for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models since Google's Jason Wei research team introduced it in 2022. The dramatic performance improvements achieved by showing intermediate reasoning steps for complex problems sent shockwaves through the AI industry.

However, recent studies have begun to expose the limitations and problems of CoT. Two important papers published in 2024 and 2025 reveal that CoT is not the universal solution we thought it was, and in certain situations, it can actually degrade performance. This post provides an in-depth analysis of CoT's evolution alongside these limitation-revealing studies.

## The Emergence and Success of Chain-of-Thought

### Birth of a Revolutionary Idea

Chain-of-Thought prompting was first introduced in January 2022 by Google Research's Jason Wei, Xuezhi Wang, Dale Schuurmans, and others in their paper "Chain-of-Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models."

The core idea of this technique is simple yet powerful. While traditional few-shot prompting only provided input-output pairs, CoT includes intermediate reasoning steps to show the model's "thinking process."

For example, where traditional methods would simply answer "21 people" to the question "There were 23 people in a caf√©, 7 left and 5 entered. How many are there now?", the CoT approach would elaborate: "Initially there were 23 people. 7 people left, so 23 minus 7 equals 16 people remaining. Then 5 people entered, so 16 plus 5 equals 21 people."

### Remarkable Performance Gains

Wei et al.'s research showed outstanding results in three key areas:

1. **Arithmetic Reasoning**: On the GSM8K math problem benchmark, a 540B parameter model surpassed previous best performance with just 8 CoT examples.

2. **Commonsense Reasoning**: Consistent performance improvements were observed in reasoning about everyday situations.

3. **Symbolic Reasoning**: Particularly notable improvements were seen in problems involving logical rules and patterns.

### Widespread Industry Adoption

CoT's success rapidly spread throughout the industry. Major LLMs including OpenAI's GPT series, Anthropic's Claude, and Google's Gemini actively adopted CoT techniques. Especially for complex mathematical problems, logical puzzles, and tasks requiring multi-step reasoning, CoT became viewed as an essential tool.

## Research Exposing CoT's Limitations

However, behind CoT's brilliant success lay overlooked problems. Two important studies published in 2024 and 2025 systematically analyzed these limitations.

### 1. "The Curse of CoT" (2025)

#### Research Overview

"The Curse of CoT: On the Limitations of Chain-of-Thought in In-Context Learning," published in April 2025 by Tianshi Zheng's team at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, is a large-scale study addressing CoT's fundamental limitations.

#### Experimental Design and Findings

The research team conducted extensive experiments using 16 state-of-the-art LLMs and 9 pattern-based In-Context Learning (ICL) datasets. Surprisingly, the results were opposite to existing beliefs:

- **Consistent Performance Degradation**: CoT and its variants (ReAct, Tree-of-Thought, etc.) consistently showed lower performance than direct answers.
- **Model Scale Irrelevant**: This phenomenon appeared regardless of model size or benchmark complexity.
- **More Sophisticated Variants Performed Worse**: Advanced reasoning frameworks like ReAct and ToT showed even lower performance.

#### Causal Analysis: Explicit-Implicit Duality

The research team explained this phenomenon through "explicit-implicit duality":

1. **Failure of Explicit Reasoning**: LLMs struggle to infer fundamental patterns from demonstrations.

2. **Interference with Implicit Reasoning**: CoT's intermediate explanations increase contextual distance, destroying the few-shot learning structure.

3. **Noise Effects**: Noise from weak explicit reasoning impedes the entire reasoning process.

### 2. "Chain of Thoughtlessness?" (2024)

#### Research Overview

"Chain of Thoughtlessness? An Analysis of CoT in Planning," published in May 2024 by Kaya Stechly, Karthik Valmeekam, and Subbarao Kambhampati from Arizona State University, specifically analyzed CoT's limitations in planning tasks.

#### Experiments in Blocksworld

The research team tested CoT's generalization ability using the classic planning domain Blocksworld. The results were shocking:

1. **Extremely Limited Generalization**: CoT showed meaningful performance improvements only when prompts were extremely specialized to the problem class.

2. **Rapid Performance Degradation**: Performance dropped sharply when query-specified stack sizes exceeded those in examples.

3. **Failure to Learn Algorithms**: It was revealed that CoT doesn't teach models general algorithmic procedures but relies on highly problem-specific prompts.

#### Validation in Other Domains

The research team created scalable variants of three domains frequently used in previous CoT studies. Results showed the same failure modes, suggesting that the problems found in Blocksworld were general phenomena.

## Fundamental Causes of CoT's Limitations

Synthesizing both studies, CoT's limitations appear at multiple levels:

### 1. Fundamental Difficulty in Pattern Reasoning

LLMs have structural limitations in inferring fundamental patterns or rules from demonstration pairs. This appears to be a fundamental limitation of current transformer architectures and learning methods, not simply a matter of model size or training data.

### 2. Increased Contextual Distance

CoT's intermediate explanations increase "contextual distance" between demonstrations and final answers. This can interfere with pattern recognition, the core mechanism of few-shot learning, actually leading to performance degradation.

### 3. Reliability Issues in Reasoning Processes

The intermediate reasoning steps generated by CoT often lack causal relationships with final answers. Even when models produce correct answers, their reasoning processes are frequently flawed or even logically incorrect.

### 4. Failure of Generalization

CoT only shows effectiveness with prompts highly specialized to specific problem classes, with performance dropping sharply when problems are even slightly modified. This suggests it's closer to simple pattern matching rather than genuine reasoning ability improvement.

## Practical Implications and Alternative Exploration

### 1. Precautions When Using CoT

These research findings suggest the following precautions when using CoT in practice:

- **Clear Problem Domain Definition**: Clearly identify specific problem types where CoT is effective.
- **Recognition of Generalization Limits**: Recognize CoT's extreme dependence on prompts and avoid over-generalization.
- **Building Verification Mechanisms**: Separate verification mechanisms are needed to ensure CoT's reasoning processes are actually valid.

### 2. Alternative Approaches

Several alternatives are being proposed to overcome CoT's limitations:

- **Hybrid Approaches**: Methods appropriately combining explicit and implicit reasoning
- **Domain-specific Optimization**: Development of reasoning mechanisms specialized for specific domains
- **Enhanced Verification**: Systems independently verifying each step of the reasoning process

## Future Research Directions

### 1. Understanding Reasoning Mechanisms

To overcome CoT's limitations, we must first gain a deeper understanding of the fundamental mechanisms by which LLMs perform reasoning. This includes research areas such as:

- **Internal Representation Analysis**: Analyzing how transformer attention patterns and internal representations work during reasoning processes
- **Scaling Law Reexamination**: New understanding of the relationship between model size and reasoning ability
- **Architecture Improvements**: Exploring new architectures more suitable for reasoning

### 2. Improving Evaluation Methodologies

A reexamination is needed of whether current benchmarks and evaluation methodologies are suitable for measuring CoT's true capabilities:

- **Measuring Generalization Ability**: Methods for more accurately measuring robustness to problem variations
- **Evaluating Reasoning Processes**: Metrics evaluating the quality of reasoning processes themselves, not just final answers
- **Domain-specific Evaluation**: Evaluation systems reflecting the characteristics of each domain

### 3. New Reasoning Paradigms

Research on new reasoning paradigms beyond CoT is actively ongoing:

- **Tool-augmented Reasoning**: Reasoning systems linked with external tools
- **Multi-modal Reasoning**: Reasoning integrating text, images, formulas, etc.
- **Collaborative Reasoning**: Reasoning systems where multiple models cooperate

## Conclusion: Toward New Horizons in Reasoning

Chain-of-Thought has certainly made important contributions to LLM research. However, as recent studies show, CoT is not a universal solution and has clear limitations. "The Curse of CoT" and "Chain of Thoughtlessness" provide important insights by systematically analyzing these limitations.

The key is not to blindly trust CoT, but to recognize its limitations and develop better reasoning methodologies. The explicit-implicit duality of reasoning, fundamental difficulties in pattern reasoning, and failures of generalization are all challenges that must be overcome.

Future research should acknowledge these limitations and move toward developing more robust and generalizable reasoning systems. CoT's failures are not an end but a new beginning. The journey toward true machine reasoning may have just begun.
